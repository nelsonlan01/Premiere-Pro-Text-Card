# Premiere-Pro-Text-Card
The following Premiere Pro Text Card Animations are produced by Nelson LAN,
who stores a backup of his favourite setting and layout of animation for his school video editing.

He wanted to share and publish them into a public open-source project, let more people contribute, and make it free to use in the rest of the world
It also aims to train multimedia production skills.
